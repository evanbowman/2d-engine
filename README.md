# SGE

A simple 2d game engine. It is designed around an entity component model, and a system of unique integer handles to resources that the engine exposes in its API. Because the engine communicates via integer identifiers, it could theoretically be plugged into any scripting engine; I plan on moving to a plugin based architecture for the script system in the near future. This project is in its early stages, but still very usable. 

I am developing a game with it in parallel, see here: https://github.com/evanbowman/platformer/tree/master
